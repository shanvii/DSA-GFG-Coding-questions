https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/array-pair-sum-divisibility-problem3257/1

Given an array of integers nums and a number k, write a function that returns true if given array can be divided into pairs such that sum of every pair is divisible by k.

**Your Task:**
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function canPair() which takes array nums and k as input parameter and returns true if array can be divided into pairs such that sum of every pair is divisible by k otherwise returns false.  <br/>

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)  <br/>  
Expected Space Complexity : O(n)  <br/>

**Constraints:**  <br/>
1 <= length( nums ) <= 105 <br/>
1 <= numsi <= 105  <br/>
1 <= k <= 105  <br/>
