<h2>Largest Sum Subarray of Size at least K</h2>

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/largest-sum-subarray-of-size-at-least-k3121/1

Given an array a of length n and a number k, find the largest sum of the subarray containing at least k numbers. It is guaranteed that the size of array is at-least k.
 <br>
<h3>Example 1:</h3> <br>

**Input :** <br> 
n = 4 <br>
a[] = {1, -2, 2, -3} <br>
k = 2 <br>

**Output :** <br> 
1 <br>
Explanation : <br>
The sub-array of length at-least 2 <br>
that produces greatest sum is {1, -2, 2} <br>

<h3>Example 2:</h3> <br>
**Input :** <br>
n = 6  <br>
a[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1} <br>
k = 2 <br>

**Output :** <br> 
6 <br>
Explanation : <br>
The sub-array of length at-least 2 <br>
that produces greatest sum is {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1} <br>

**Your Task:** <br>  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function maxSumWithK() which takes the array a[], its size n and an integer k as inputs and returns the value of the largest sum of the subarray containing at least k numbers.
 <br>
Expected Time Complexity: O(n) <br>
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n) <br>

Constraints: <br>
1 <= n <= 10^5
-105 <= a[i] <= 10^5 <br>
1 <= k <= n <br>
