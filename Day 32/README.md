Given a length n, count the number of strings of length n that can be made using a, b and c with at-most one b and two c allowed.

## Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countStr() which takes the n as inputs and returns the total number of valid strings.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(1)  <br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

## Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 105
