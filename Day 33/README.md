<h1>Max Sum without Adjacents</h1>

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/max-sum-without-adjacents2430/1

Given an array Arr of size N containing positive integers. Find the maximum sum of a any possible subsequence such that no two numbers in the subsequence should be adjacent in Arr.

## Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findMaxSum() which takes the array of integers Arr and N as parameters and returns an the maximum sum possible of any valid subsequence.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N)  <br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

## Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105  <br>
1 ≤ Arri ≤ 105
