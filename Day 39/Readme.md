<h2>Count More than n/k Occurences</h2>

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-element-occurences/1

Given an array arr of size N and an element k. The task is to find the count of elements in the array that appear more than n/k times. <br>
 <br>
<h3>Example 1:</h3> <br>

**Input:** <br>
N = 8 <br>
arr = [3,1,2,2,1,2,3,3] <br>
k = 4 <br>
**Output:** 
2 <br>
Explanation:  <br>
In the given array, 3 and 2 are the only elements that appears more than n/k times. <br>

<h3>Example 2:</h3> <br>
 <br>
**Input:**
N = 4 <br>
arr = [2,3,3,2] <br>
k = 3 <br>
**Output:** <br> 
2 <br>
Explanation: In the given array, 3 and 2 are the only elements that appears more than n/k times. So the count of elements are 2. <br>
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function countOccurence() which returns count of elements with more than n/k times appearance. <br>
 <br>
Expected Time Complexity: O(N). <br>
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N). <br>
 <br>
Constraints: <br>
1 <= N <= 10^5 <br>
1 <= a[i] <= 10^9 <br>
1 <= k <= N
